# Reproducing "An Introduction to State Space Time Series Analysis" using Stan

Trying to reproduce the examples introduced in "An Introduction to State Space Time Series Analysis" using Stan.

## Data

SOURCE: http://www.ssfpack.com/CKbook.html

- `data/`
    - `logUKpetrolprice.txt`
    - `NorwayFinland.txt`
    - `UKdriversKSI.txt`
    - `UKinflation.txt`
    - `UKfrontrearseatKSI.txt`

## R scripts

All the R scripts are in `R/`.

All the original files were edited to be more concise. In many cases, I switch from using ggplot2 to base R graphics.

Each file is tied to a headline figure. Most files will also carry forward and plot any proceeding plots between one headline figure and the next e.g. `fig04_02.R` creates figures `4.2` - `4.5`, up to the next headline file `fig04_06.R`. This is not always the case, particularly in Chapter 8 where consecutive plots jump between different datasets. Instead, in Chapter 8, I sort of pick and choose the figures where I thought there was the most to be learned from attempted replication.

Figures that I added are labeled with "*(NEW)**" in the list below.

I'll add more over time. Feel free to contribute as well.

1. Introduction
    - fig01_01.R: Linear regression
2. The local level model
    - fig02_01.R: Deterministic level

3. The local linear trend model
    - fig03_01.R: Stochastic level and slope
    - fig03_04.R: Stochastic level and deterministic slope
    - fig03_05.R: The local linear trend model and Finnish fatalities
